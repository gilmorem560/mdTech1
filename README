mdTech1 - a simple megadrive engine

Building
--------

This engine currently uses GNU Binutils 2.16.1 targeting m68k-md-coff. Simply
adjust the AS and LD environment variables in the Makefile according to your
local toolchain setup. GCC 3.3.6 can also be built targeting m68k-md-coff and
I am currently exploring options to integrate C code.

Base Components
---------------

	header	- the 68000 and system headers
	utility	- useful subroutines
	ctrl 	- controller subroutines
	hint	- horizontal interrupt subroutine
	vint	- vertical interrupt subroutine
	main	- main game init and routines

Headers
-------

	md		- megadrive constants
	vars	- variables and constants

Graphics
--------

	config	- graphics configuration
	sprites	- sprite-related operations
	planes	- scrollplane-related operations
